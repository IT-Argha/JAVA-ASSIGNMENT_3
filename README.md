# JAVA-ASSIGNMENT_3

1. Write a Java program to create a class called Employee with methods called
work() and getSalary(). Create a subclass called HRManager that overrides the
work() method and adds a new method called addEmployee().

2. Write a Java program to create a class known as Person with methods called
getFirstName() and getLastName(). Create a subclass called Employee that
adds a new method named getEmployeeId() and overrides the getLastName()
method to include the employee's job title.

3. Write a Java program to create a vehicle class hierarchy. The base class
should be Vehicle, with subclasses Truck, Car and Motorcycle. Each subclass
should have properties such as make, model, year, and fuel type. Implement
methods for calculating fuel efficiency, distance traveled, and maximum speed.

4. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Employee with abstract
methods calculateSalary() and displayInfo(). Create subclasses Manager and
Programmer that extend the Employee class and implement the respective
methods to calculate salary and display information for each role.

5. Write a Java program to create an abstract class GeometricShape with
abstract methods area() and perimeter(). Create subclasses Triangle and Square
that extend the GeometricShape class and implement the respective methods
to calculate the area and perimeter of each shape.

6. Write a Java program to create an interface Playable with a method play()
that takes no arguments and returns void. Create three classes Football,
Volleyball, and Basketball that implement the Playable interface and override
the play() method to play the respective sports.

7. Write a java program to implement multiple inheritance through interface.
    
8. Write a Java program to create a class called Car with private instance
variables company_name, model_name, year, and mileage. Provide public
getter and setter methods to access and modify the company_name,
model_name, and year variables. However, only provide a getter method for
the mileage variable.

9. Write a Java program to create a class called Student with private instance
variables student_id, student_name, and grades. Provide public getter and
setter methods to access and modify the student_id and student_name
variables. However, provide a method called addGrade() that allows adding a
grade to the grades variable while performing additional validation.

10. Write a Java program to create a base class Shape with methods draw() and
calculateArea(). Create three subclasses: Circle, Square, and Triangle. Override
the draw() method in each subclass to draw the respective shape, and override
the calculateArea() method to calculate and return the area of each shape.
